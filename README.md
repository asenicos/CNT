# Color Naming Test (CNT)
A Color Naming Test (CNT) programmed using PsychoPy, with help of ChatGPT-4o.
The scope of the project is to make relevant test for [Inverted Spectrum experiment](https://osf.io/ed4sy/), so the stimuli were set as opposite colors. 

## Example results
The reaction time in response to normal and inverted color stimuli differs insignificantly (t-statistic 0.87, p-value: 0.3855690048):

The accuracy of the responses differs significantly: the first two columns are for normal colors, while the second two are for inverted colors (normal accuracy and accuracy considering opposing colors):

The dependencies of reaction time on different colors are not noticeable:
